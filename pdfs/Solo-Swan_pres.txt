Data Preparation
At the beginning of our analysis there is a rigorous data processing and preparation segment to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. Initially, it retrieves the relevant economic
indicators for the Solow-Swan model (GDP per capita - “NY.GDP.PCAP.CD”, savings rate - “NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS”, and population growth rate - “SP.POP.GROW”) by using the WDI function from
the WDI package, which gives access to the WDI database for all countries. To ensure data integrity, complete cases—observations without missing values—are retained for further
analysis. The datasets are then merged based on the years and the ISO 3 country code. Finally, a log transformation is applied to the variables, with an offset added to handle zero
values, thereby preparing the dataset for the linear regression.

Cleaning Datasets

Regression with outliers

Regression without outliers

To perform the regression we decided to focus solely on individual country-level observations and not on aggregates.
Avoiding medians helped us to ensured a linear regression model based on granular and diverse observations, leading to
more accurate and reliable results. We further cleaned the data by excluding observations that are found to be less
influential in regression analysis. To do so, we compute the Cook's distance, which helped in quantifying the effect of
removing each observation on the regression coefficients, allowing us to identify these potential outliers and thus avoid
potential bias in our model and ensure that our variance is not inflated due to this data.

Interpretation of the Results
As it can be seen from the graphs and from the computation of the R-squared coefficient (0.12 versus 0.3), there is a significant
difference in performing a regression on the model with and without outliers. The data fit better the model having lower
variance and not being biased by outliers. In both cases the model suggests that both savings_rate and population_growth are
statistically significant predictors of gdp_per_capita, with savings_rate having a positive impact and population_growth a negative one.
However, an R-squared value of approximately 0.3 indicates that while there is still a significant relationship, the model doesn't
capture all the variability in the data even if we remove the outliers, and there may be other factors influencing gdp_per_capita that are
not included in the model.

Analysis of the R-Squared values over time
Initially, when data is limited to fewer observations per year, the model effectively captures the variation in GDP per capita
based on the available explanatory variables. This leads to higher R-squared values. However, as the number of
observations per year increases over time, the model's explanatory power diminishes, reflected in lower R-squared values,
as it struggles to capture a strong relationship if subjected to a significantly larger number of data. We can see though that
during the last 10 years there has been an improvement that suggests that savings and population growth could possibly
influence more gdppc than before.

Results
The high RESET statistic and the very low p-value
indicate that the model may have omitted important
variables or the relationship between the predictors
and the outcome is not correctly specified
The p-value is strictly above the typical alpha level
of 0.5, suggesting that there is strong evidence on
H0 supporting constant variance

The first BP statistic is 11.496 with a p-value
of 0.003189, indicating strong evidence of
heteroscedasticity. The second BP statistic is
significantly larger at 208.36 with a p-value <
2.2e-16, which further supports the presence
of heteroscedasticity

This test provides a
strong
evidence of serial correlation in the
residuals up to order 5

The Jarque-Bera statistic is 29.23 with a p-value of
4.496e-07, suggesting that the residuals do not follow
a normal distribution, which is an important
assumption in many regression models

The inclusion of transformed variables, savings_rate_2 and
population_growth_2, alters the coefficients of the original
variables, suggesting a possible non-linear relationship with
GDP per capita. Savings_rate now has a large negative
coefficient, while population_growth has a large positive
one, indicating a more complex relationship.
Both transformed variables are statistically significant,
capturing additional aspects of the relationship not
explained by the original variables alone. The adjusted Rsquared of 0.3026 suggests a slightly better fit than the
original model, but still relatively low.

Political Stability
We have considered several additional variables that could be influential, among which political stability is the one that convinced us the most. The
economic intuitions for which we expected a positive correlation between political stability and GDP per capita are many:
Investment Confidence: Political stability creates a predictable
and secure environment for both domestic and foreign
investors. Higher levels of investment in turn can lead to more
robust economic growth and thus higher GDP per capita.
Attracting Talent and Skills: Politically stable countries are
more attractive destinations for talented individuals and skilled
workers from around the world. The influx of skills and talent
can enhance innovation, productivity, and economic growth,
leading to higher GDP per capita.

Economic Policies: Politically stable environments tend to
facilitate the development and implementation of coherent and
consistent economic policies. Governments in stable countries
are more likely to be able to plan for the long term, implement
necessary reforms, and ensure policy continuity. This
consistency helps in creating a conducive environment for
economic growth.
Risk of Conflict: Politically unstable regions are at a higher risk
of conflicts, which can have devastating effects on the economy.

When choosing the additional variable we also
considered the correlation between the latter
and GDP per Capita. As it can be perceived
from the graph, the relationship between
our additional variable and GDP is pretty
linear. Political stability is a good proxy
especially for higher GDP, meaning that when
there is a high GDP the political stability index
is high too, while the opposite is not
necessarily true.

We hence ran a regression on Political Stability and Absence of
Violence/Terrorism which is an index that evaluates the
perceived stability of a country's political environment and the
absence of violence or terrorism. It considers factors such as
government effectiveness, rule of law, control of corruption, and
the likelihood of political unrest or violent conflicts. To handle the
data we adopted the same procedure we followed in the first
regression model.

Results
Linear Model with Political Stability
In the refined econometric model, the R-squared value robustly captures 50.87% of GDP per capita’s
variability, significantly improving upon the previous iteration by taking into account political stability.
Economically, the model suggests a unitary increase in the savings rate correlates with a 6.98
increment in GDP per capita, reflective of the classical economic theory positing that savings fuel
investments leading to growth. The negative coefficient for population growth aligns with the
Malthusian perspective where unchecked growth potentially dilutes per capita wealth creation. The
inclusion of political stability, with its substantial coefficient of 3.49, underscores the decisive role
governance plays in economic development. This particular variable’s elasticity indicates a considerable
sway over GDP, likely due to its effect on attracting investments, securing property rights, and ensuring
a stable economic trajectory, fundamental elements conducive to robust economic growth.

Similarly to the previous results, after removing outliers the regression model captures better the underlying patterns in the data and provides more
accurate estimates of the true relationships between variables. This enhances the reliability of the regression results and improves the model's
predictive power.
Analysis of Residuals
The diagnostic residual plot elucidates the presence of heteroscedasticity, a common variance anomaly in cross-country
analyses, where the scatter of residuals broadens with an increase in GDP per capita. This breach of homoscedasticity suggests
the error variance is not uniform across all levels of GDP and our model is flawed: lower GDP nations are consistently
underpredicted while the opposite holds for higher GDP nations. This may be a reflection of latent non-linearities not captured
by the current model or omitted variables that exert disproportionate influence at different income levels. Economically, this
implies that uniform policy prescriptions across diverse economic landscapes could be ineffectual, as the model’s residuals
indicate varying sensitivities to the explanatory variables. This pattern warrants a transformation of variables or the adoption of a
heteroscedasticity-consistent estimation technique to rectify the non-constant variance and achieve unbiased standard errors,
thereby ensuring the model’s coefficients are truly representative of the underlying economic phenomena.

Comparison of the results
The significant increase in the adjusted R-squared
value upon including the political stability index
parameter in the Solow model regression
highlights the substantial explanatory power of
political stability we expected on variations in
economic growth, as captured by GDP per capita.

The similarity in the average pattern of
residuals between the two regressions
suggests underlying economic forces
or data characteristics that transcend
the inclusion of political stability. This
similarity implies that the addition of
the political stability index to the
regression
model
does
not
substantially
alter
the
residual
patterns, indicating that other factors
not captured by the political stability
index may be driving the observed
residuals.

Reasoning about the change in regression parameters due to Inclusion of Political Stability
The revised model’s coefficients, adjusted for political stability, provide a nuanced understanding of its interplay with economic indicators. Political stability, with its
notable coefficient, possibly absorbs some predictive power from savings rate and population growth, refining their estimated effects on GDP per capita. This could
be due to political stability’s potential correlation with these factors, suggesting that it functions as a control variable that helps to disentangle their individual
contributions to economic growth.
Econometrically, the reduction in the magnitude of the coefficients for savings rate and population growth upon including political stability suggests a re-allocation
of their explained variance. It highlights how the absence of a key variable—political stability—might have led to over or underestimation of the others' influence.
The kind of errors this adjustment addresses includes specification errors due to omitted variable bias, where political stability acts as a latent factor influencing
the relationship between savings, population growth, and GDP per capita. Additionally, multicollinearity concerns are partially alleviated, as the shared variance
between savings rate, population growth, and political stability is now more accurately attributed, leading to more stable coefficient estimates and a clearer picture
of the underlying economic structure.
