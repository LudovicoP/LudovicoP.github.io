Introduction of warning labels on super alcohol bottles to raise
awareness and provide information about the risks of alcohol

The research investigates the effectiveness
of the proposal in achieving two main goals

Research
Objectives

1

Improve public trust in the government
Explore the relationship between consumer
behavior and the role of the state in
protecting public health

2

Reduce alcohol consumption
Examine the effects of these interventions across
various demographic groups in Italy, such as age,
gender, and socioeconomic status

Experimental design
Experiment will include supermarkets
in several italian big cities
Randomized Control Trial:
treatment: introduction of
warning labels
control: no warning labels
Duration: 1 year

Model 1: Citizen Satisfaction

dependent variable = citizen satisfaction score
target variable = 1 for individuals in target group and 0 for individuals in the control group
interaction term between treatment αi and control variable

+

control variables that account for individual demographics and experience

Model 2: Purchase of Super Alcohol

dependent variable = comulative super alcohol purchase per individual
target variable = 1 for individuals in target group and 0 for individuals in the control group
interaction term between treatment αi and control variable

+

control variables that account for individual demographics and experience

Data Collection
Data will be collected from fidelity card system and targeted surveys
Surveys will be administered both online and in-store at individuals in both groups

PRIMARY DATA
Customer Satisfaction Score
Calculated from responses to a survey
Questions will evaluate:
Overall Satisfaction
Expectancy Disconfirmation
Comparison to an Ideal
Purchase
Treatment Indicator
Region

Demographic Controls
Age bins, Gender, Education level,
Nationality, Smoking habits, Ethnicity,
Income
Additional Controls
Political participation, Political
association, Public health usage,
Preference for public or private service,
Informedness on political issue

Evaluation of Results
1

Estimation of the model through OLS

2

Evaluation of significance of the model through an F-test

3

Evaluation of significance of the treatment variable through a t-test
Interpretation of coefficient as average change in alcohol spending/ citizen
satisfaction when moving from control to treatment

4

Activation of interaction terms and evaluation of significance through t-test
Interpretation of coefficient as the additional marginal effect of the treatment on the
selected sub-group

Expected main positive drivers for Citizen
Satisfaction and Alcohol Consumption

Age: higher responsiveness for
young adults
Higher education level
Higher Income
Regional differences
Non-smokers

Expectations

Implications

Drawbacks

Improved public trust, which may foster
cooperation on other health-related
policies
Healthier population, which is could lower
healthcare costs and improve service
deliver

Follwing steps

Negative impact on firms
Possible economic bonuses
Long-term effects on NHS may take time
Cultural resistance could limit the success
of the experiment

Sustained communication and transparency to maintain
satisfaction
Targeted campaign, based on the results of the interaction
terms
Combined approach, in case of positive results on
consumption reduction, but negative on satisfaction
