Theoretical question and theoretical
model
The paper by Florian Dorn, Clemens Fuest and Niklas
Potrafke examines the relationship between trade
openness and income inequality, and explores how
it changes across different types of countries: developing, developed, and transition countries.
Their analysis is based on the Heckscher-Ohlin (HO)
model (Ohlin, 1933) and the Stolper-Samuelson theorem (Stolper and Samuelson, 1941). The HO model
suggests that trade openness affects income inequality based on a country’s factors of production and
their dependence on labor or capital. Countries specialize in goods that use their abundant factors and
export them. The Stolper-Samuelson theorem predicts
that trade raises returns for abundant factors used in
export production and lowers returns for scarce factors. In developed nations with abundant capital and
skilled labor, trade can increase income inequality by
moving wages concentration towards the top. Conversely, in developing countries where unskilled labor
is abundant, trade can decrease income inequality by
boosting these wages. However, several studies have
pointed out limitations of the standard HO model
implications; moreover also the empirical evidence is
mixed and hardly reports causal effects.

Estimation methodology, variables
and country sub-samples
The study used unbalanced panel data from 139
countries in the period 1970-2014, following the
literature the data are averaged over five years in nine
periods between 1970 and 2014.
To measure income inequality, it was used the
Gini household income inequality indices of Solt’s
(2016) Standardized World Income Inequality
Database (SWIID, v5.1). SWIID provides standardized
Gini income inequality measures for market and net
outcomes, allowing comparisons of income inequality
before and after taxes and over time. To measure
trade openness, it was used the sum of imports and
exports as a share of GDP.
Moreover they included different control variables: real GDP per capita, to control for any
distributional effect due to different income levels;
the age dependency ratio and the logarithm of total
population, in fact, demographic changes influence
both international trade and the income distribution,
and the KOF globalization sub-indices for political
and social globalization and an index for FDIs; in
fact, trade openness is correlated with migration and
political globalization.
The instrumental variable (IV) is predicted openness;
and is constructed by using a gravity model including
exogenous large-scale natural disasters in other
2

countries, since they influence trade openness and the
per capita income level of countries. Note that they
controlled for the effect of large-scale natural disasters
on the income distribution within countries, in order
to check that the estimated relationship between
trade and inequality is not driven by the correlation
between disasters registered in the home country and
income inequality.
Full and benchmark samples: they both used
the full sample of 139 countries, and a sample for high
and upper middle income countries as a benchmark
sample, following the World Bank criterion. 57
countries are classified as lower income countries;
however because of the concerns about the quality of
the income inequality data they were excluded from
the the benchmark sample.
Development levels: they used sub-samples for the
most advanced economies and emerging markets
& developing economies (EMD), according to the
classification of the International Monetary Fund. 34
countries are classified as advanced economies and
are included in the benchmark sample; 105 countries
make up the sub-sample of EMD economies and are
taken from both income groups.
Transition economies: transition economies have
experienced a large shift in trade openness, which
was not, however, cushioned by the welfare state. The
transition toward market economies might therefore
be an omitted driver of trade openness and inequality
in transition countries. A sample of the new European
Union member states from Central and Eastern
Europe and China contributes to a large extent to
changes in the global income distribution since the
fall of the Berlin Wall.

Descriptive statistics
Trade openness and income inequality
across countries
As we can see in Figure 1 , between 2010 and 2014,
income inequality before taxes (Gini market) is hardly
correlated with trade openness (0.01), while income
inequality after taxes and transfers (Gini net) is negatively correlated with trade openness (-0.17). In this
period, Gini net is on average 9.8 index points lower
than the Gini market. Moreover, net income inequality
in open countries is lower than in less open countries
because of larger welfare states.

Trends across samples and countries
As we can see in Figure 2 , trade openness and income
inequality both increased rapidly between the 1980s
and the 1990s, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and in
the 2000s. Gini market and Gini net both decreased
from the early 2000s in EMD economies; meanwhile, in
advanced economies, Gini net remained stable while
Gini market has increased; that indicates a rise of redistribution. Before taxation and transfers, income

inequality is at a similar level in advanced and EMD
economies; while after taxation and transfers, inequality is much lower in advanced economies than in EMD
economies.
There is a positive correlation between the changes
in trade openness and the market and net income
inequality in countries of the benchmark sample between the periods 1990-1994 and 2005-2009. There
are, however, two groups of countries that are the
key drivers of the linear relationship: on one hand
Hong Kong, Luxembourg and Singapore are outliers
regarding trade openness; on the other the transition
countries in Eastern Europe and China experienced
a huge opening process and a huge rise in income
inequality during that time. Excluding the outliers,
the correlation is almost zero; while after excluding
outliers and transition countries, the correlation is negative instead.

Empirical Strategy
OLS Panel FE Model
To estimate the baseline panel model using OLS, they
applied the following relationship:
Yi,τ = β × TRADEi,τ + Θ′ × χi,τ + νi + ντ + ϵi,τ

as predictors. These disasters serve as exogenous
shocks affecting trade openness due to geographic
and temporal variations.
Instrument Construction:
the predicted trade
i,j
openness ω̂t is constructed through a two-step
process:
i,j

i,j

• χi,τ is a vector of control variables.
• νi and ντ are the country and period fixed effects,
respectively.
• ϵi,τ is the error term.
This method exploits within-country variation over
time, eliminating observable and unobservable
country-specific time-invariant effects and includes
fixed time effects to control for period-specific shocks
that influence multiple countries simultaneously. The
standard errors are robust to heteroscedasticity and
are clustered at the country level.

2SLS Panel IV Model & Endogeneity
Problem
The trade openness variable may suffer from endogeneity due to omitted variable bias and reverse
causality. Possible omitted variables include factors
like competition from low-cost countries prompting
high-income countries to specialize in high-tech goods.
Reverse causality can arise from changes in income
inequality affecting trade policies.
Gravity Equation as an Instrumental Variable
(IV): to address the endogeneity of trade openness,
they used a gravity model as an IV, incorporating
exogenous natural disasters in foreign countries

i,j

where the variables are defined as follows:

= [ln( POPi · POPj ); ln( DISTi,j

• D tj represents large-scale natural disasters in country j.
t = [ln( FI NDIST ); ln( AREA ); ln( POP ); BOR ]
• ϕi,j
i,j

includes variables interacting with D tj such as
financial remoteness, area, and population.
t is
Fixed effects are captured by vi , v j , and vt , and ϵi,j
the idiosyncratic error.
In the second step of constructing the IV, they aggret across
gated predicted bilateral openness values ωi,j
all bilateral country pairs and years to form the multilateral openness Ωi,t :

• Yi,τ is the income inequality of country i in period
τ.
• TRADEi,τ is the trade openness of country i in
period τ.

i,j

ωt = exp(δ × Di + γ × Zt + λ × (Φt × Di ) + vi + v j + vt + ϵt )

Ωi,t = ∑ ωi,j
i̸= j

Using this aggregated measure, they derived the instrument for TRADEi,t based on data from 1966 to
2008, employing one-period lags of predicted openness for robustness.

Results Analysis
Baseline results
The average effect of trade openness on Gini income inequality is examined in the full and benchmark sample,
but the results initially do not suggest a statistically
significant relationship between trade openness and
income inequality. Indeed the baseline specifications,
in line with predictions of the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, which predicts that trade openness increases
inequality in developed countries and decreases inequality in developing countries, do not confirm that
trade openness influences equality within countries
when they used large country samples.

Subsample results
The analysis focuses on the impact of trade openness
on income distribution across different income groups
(deciles), using 2SLS regression with relative net income shares as dependent variables. The findings indicate no significant overall relationship between trade
openness and income inequality for the entire sample.
However, a more distinct relationship emerges in a
3

specific subset (the benchmark sample), revealing that
trade openness negatively affects the income shares
of lower income deciles (1 to 7) and positively affects
those of higher income deciles, although the changes
are small.
Significantly, for the upper middle class in the 9th
decile, an increase in trade openness by ten percentage
points corresponds to a 0.12 percentage point increase
in their income share, a finding statistically significant
at the 5% level. According to the Stolper-Samuelson
theorem, the results vary by economic development
level: in developing economies, the poorest benefit
from trade openness at the expense of higher income
deciles, whereas in advanced economies, the upper
middle class gains disproportionately at the expense
of lower income deciles. The analysis confirms the
relevance of the instrument used, as indicated by the
Cragg-Donald Wald F-statistic surpassing critical values in both subsamples.

Outliers and transition countries
The unconditional relationship between the change
in trade openness and income inequality seems to be
driven by outliers in trade openness and by Central
and Eastern European transition countries (East EU)
and China. The effect of trade openness on income
inequality is therefore examined when outliers and
transition countries are excluded from the analysis:
• Excluding Singapore as an outlier, the effect of
trade openness on income inequality becomes
statistically insignificant across advanced and
benchmark economies, revealing varied but nonsignificant impacts on different income groups.
• Excluding China and East EU transition countries
from the benchmark sample results in smaller
coefficient estimates for trade openness, which
are not statistically significant. Without these
countries, the effect of trade openness on income
shares becomes negligible or negative when using
Gini indices as dependent variables. However, after excluding transition countries from the benchmark sample, there was no overall inequalityincreasing effect of trade openness in a large
sample of advanced and emerging economies,
consistent with the predictions of the HO model
(Stolper-Samuelson theorem).

Limits and further analysis
The paper presents some limits:
1. Data Quality and Availability: The concern
about the quality of income inequality data, particularly in less developed countries, is crucial.
As a fact, the authors are aware of the concerns
over the reliability of SWIID’s imputed estimates
in data-poor regions. Moreover, it does not show
which parts of a country’s income distribution
gain or lose and cause changes in the Gini index,
therefore it was also employed the data on relative
4

net income shares of the Global Consumption and
Income Project (GCIP) by Lahoti et al. (2016) as a
measure of post tax and transfer income inequality.
2. Usage of Export-Import Only as an Indicator of
Trade Openness: Despite being on of the most
relevant indicator to measure the openness of an
economy in the literature, the indicator could be
expanded by incorporating alternative indicators
such as trade in services and digital trade flows,
which are increasingly relevant in today’s global
economy.
3. IV Instrument Concern: The chosen instrument,
natural disasters, poses significant challenges suggesting that the IV estimates may be biased.
• Violation of exclusion: Direct Impact on
Income Inequality: For an instrument to be
valid, it must satisfy the exclusion restriction, meaning it should affect the dependent
variable (income inequality) only through
the endogenous regressor (trade openness)
and not through any other channels. Natural disasters can directly influence income
inequality. The reconstruction efforts following a disaster often lead to increased economic activity that benefits certain segments
of the population disproportionately, potentially exacerbating income inequality. Additionally, the ability of a country to implement disaster mitigation measures is correlated with its GDP, introducing further bias.
Given that natural disasters directly affect
economic structures and income distribution,
the exclusion condition is violated.
• Violation of Exogeneity: Geographic Correlation: The incidence of natural disasters is
highly correlated with geographic location.
Countries in certain regions (e.g., the Pacific
Ring of Fire, hurricane-prone areas) are more
susceptible to natural disasters. This geographic concentration limits the variability
of the instrument across the sample, reducing its effectiveness and making it difficult
to generalize the findings.
To address these issues, we propose using a
combination of instruments that are less likely
to be directly correlated with income inequality
and provide a broader and more stable source of
exogenous variation in trade openness. These
include global technological innovations in trade,
such as the adoption of e-commerce platforms
(e.g., Amazon, eBay), which facilitate international trade (i.e. reduction of transaction costs)
without significantly impacting income inequality.
The diffusion of these technologies can be tracked
over time and across countries, providing a robust
source of exogenous variation. Additionally,
geopolitical stability indicators, which include
embargos and trade agreements, and historical
trade routes can serve as valid instruments,
influencing trade patterns while being less likely

to affect current income distribution directly.
They both provide a long-term and stable source
of variation due to data collected by WTO, IMF
or WBI. Combining these instruments enhances
the robustness and credibility of the IV estimates,
mitigating the weaknesses associated with any
single instrument.
Model Specification
Yi,t = β · TRADEi,t + Θ′ · Xi,t + νi + νt + ϵi,t (1)
First-Stage Regression
TRADEi,t = π1 · TECHi,t + π2 · GEOi,t

+ π3 · HISTi,t + Θ′ · Xi,t
+ νi + νt + ϵi,t

(2)

where:
• TECHi,t : Adoption of technological innovations in trade.
• GEOi,t : Geopolitical stability indicators.
• HISTi,t : Historical trade routes or agreements.
Second-Stage Regression
Use the predicted values of trade openness from
the first-stage regression to estimate its impact on
income inequality.
Testing Instrument Validity
• Hansen J-Test: Conduct to verify the overidentification of instruments, ensuring they
are uncorrelated with the error term.
• Stock-Yogo Test: Perform to check for
weak instruments, ensuring strong correlation with the endogenous variable.
Robustness Checks: Exclude regions where the
instrument might be overly concentrated and
check if the results hold. Include control variables
that capture the direct effects of natural disasters
and political stability on income inequality.
4. Generalization of Results: The paper rightly acknowledges that the impacts of trade openness on
income inequality vary significantly across different national contexts, highlighting the importance
of a nuanced approach in future research. To
delve deeper into the complexities of how trade
affects inequality, it is essential to examine the
interplay between trade policies and various domestic factors such as governance quality and
labor market dynamics. Future studies could enhance our understanding by incorporating interaction terms in regression analyses, which would
allow researchers to quantify how specific domestic conditions modify the effects of trade openness. Additionally, adopting a multi-level modeling approach could be beneficial. This method
would facilitate the examination of data at multi-

ple levels—for instance, individual, regional, and
national—thereby providing insights into the hierarchical nature of how trade impacts are disseminated across different layers of society.
5. Refining Econometric Models: The paper employs sophisticated econometric techniques to address the complexities of trade openness and income inequality. Further refinement could include
dynamic panel data models to account for temporal variations and lagged effects of trade policies.
Additionally, structural equation modeling (SEM)
could be used to explore indirect causal pathways,
potentially revealing how trade influences inequality through intermediary variables such as education and technology adoption. These advanced
methodologies would enhance the robustness of
the findings and provide deeper insights into the
mechanisms at play.
6. Micro-Level Analysis: The paper’s macro-level
approach highlights broad trends but may mask
heterogeneous effects at the micro level. Detailed
case studies or microdata analysis could illuminate how individual households or specific communities are affected by trade policies. This could
involve using household survey data to analyze income changes over time within specific segments
of the population. Such an analysis might reveal differential impacts not just by economic status but also by other demographic characteristics
such as education level, gender, and occupation.
Understanding these nuances could inform targeted interventions to mitigate adverse effects on
vulnerable groups.
7. Policy Evaluation: The paper hints at the varied effects of trade openness across different economic contexts but stops short of a thorough evaluation of specific trade and domestic policy combinations. Future research could benefit from a
comparative analysis of policy frameworks across
countries that successfully manage the inequality effects of trade openness. This might involve
case studies or cross-country comparisons to draw
lessons on effective combinations of trade policy
and domestic interventions, such as social safety
nets or educational reforms, aimed at distributing
the gains from trade more equitably.
Moreover, further analysis could be necessary with respect to temporal dynamics: The lack of examination
of long-term effects is a significant gap. Longitudinal
studies or the use of time series analysis could shed
light on the enduring impacts of trade on inequality,
providing insights into the dynamics that short-term
studies might miss.
