ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the causes of price variations between various accommodations under the AirBnB management, trying to individuate different
confounders. The data provided some general trends and a city-by-city prospectus. We found that costs depended on some variables: understanding
this heterogeneity is important to improve pricing, advertising, guidance for landlords and customers.

INTRODUCTION

Starting from the Dataset, we identified 5 clusters selecting variables with logical relationships between them: “placement”, “host”, “feedback”,
“location”, and “services”. After having verified the effective validity of the clusters, we carried out a first more in-depth general study. We proceeded
as follows:
1.
General comparison between the variables of the individual clusters;
2.
General comparison between the variables of the different clusters;
3.
General comparison between the different variables and the price;
After that, we repeated the same operations city by city to obtain more specific conclusions.

GENERAL TRENDS

How the different clusters affect price
An initial analysis of the clusters has revealed some general trends. The type of room is closely linked to the services offered: entire home/apartment
and private rooms are characterized by a stricter cancellation policy, the absence of the possibility of instant booking and the presence of a cleaning
fee. Instead, shared rooms have a more flexible cancellation policy, a greater possibility of instant booking and a less present cleaning fee. Vice
versa, large-scale accommodations based on shared rooms are more flexible: have a more flexible cancellation policy, a greater possibility of instant
booking and a less present cleaning fee, probably to try to fill all the seats. This trend also appears with respect to the number of beds, bathrooms,
bedrooms and accommodates: the higher the number, the stricter is the cancellation policy, the possibility of instant booking is less frequently
present, and the cleaning fee is much more frequent. However, this only held true for properties with no more
1.1
than 5 reviews, as those, again, with more reviews likely fall under the category of dormitories or large-scale
accommodations.
Linking together our previous findings, we proceeded to verify the impact of the variables on price. Entire
houses have a higher price than private rooms, which have a higher price than shared rooms. Upon analyzing
the standard deviation of this variable, we found that the standard deviation of shared rooms is higher than
that of private rooms, indicating that the prices of shared rooms vary more widely than those of private rooms
or entire home therefore more concentrated (1.1). On the other hand, private rooms have a lower standard
deviation and a higher mean. This observation reflects the difference in the prices. The insights gained from
this analysis could be useful for individuals looking to enter the platform by managing an apartment with several rooms or renting out the entire
apartment. The choice must be made obviously considering the other cofounders found inside this research. Some property types, timeshare and
vacation home, for every city have generally the highest price, while dorm and hostel the lowest. The cancellation policy has a strong impact on log
price: houses with super strict cancellation policy have a higher log price than strict, which is usually higher than moderate and flexible, this trend,
however, differs across cities.
Upon analyzing the variable 'accommodates' and creating subsets for each neighborhood, we discovered that those neighborhoods with an average
log price of 4.9 or higher typically have an average number of accommodates of at least 3. This finding suggests, as we later confirmed graphically,
that the most expensive neighborhoods are also the ones with the highest number of accommodates. This phenomenon may be indicative of higher
costs for hosts to maintain their facilities, as well as a higher demand for these locations among users. Furthermore, the central positioning of these
neighborhoods within the city further supports this observation. To conclude, we found some cofounders with no impact on the price: the host
response rate, the time an accommodation has been available and the date of the first review. Meanwhile, the effect of instant booking will be
explored city by city, since it is ambiguous.
Description and amenities are important
The following features justified higher prices for both accommodations, rarity, and cost-related services. Below we report
the most significant observations about them.
Based on the data provided, it’s evident that TV is the most prominent amenity with over 70% of accommodations offering
it, namely Boston (72.4%) Chicago (79.27%), DC (79.57%), LA (75.63%), NYC (64.08%), and SF (72.01%). The amenity has
a positive impact of as high as 0.6 when combined with the service Cable.tv, making a remarkably positive impact on the
overall value of the property.
Another crucial amenity is air conditioning, with over 89.78% of accommodations offering it in Chicago, 83.96% in NYC,
and 78.55% in Boston. It has a positive impact from 0.38 to 0.50 in Boston. Contrary to what we might expect, air
conditioning appears to be an amenity that increases the price of properties only in northern cities, perhaps because
considered as a base service in California.
The data, then, suggests that hosts consider families as an important demographic, with over 52% of accommodations
in Boston, 61% in Chicago, 61.37% in DC, 56.71% in LA, 41.99% in NYC, and 48.07% in SF catering to this demographic
adding value between 0.37 and 0.46.
Furthermore, a positive social-related amenity is the suitability for events, with 7.42% of accommodations in LA offering
it. The amenity had a positive impact of 0.44 therefore indicating a shift in price when it’s destinated to events.
Continuing, analyzing the not-so-common impacting features that underlined a premium accommodation we find gyms,
with a percentage ranging from 7.28% in NYC to 14.52% in DC; doormen with only 8.16% of accommodations in NYC and
an impact of 0.48; pools, present in 7.23% of accommodations in Chicago with a high impact of 0.46; and kitchen since
it is a costly and paid service and brings value with a positive impact of 0.36 and 0.24 for LA and SF, respectively. There
are, then, multiple amenities that affected the price of only some cities in particular and cannot be grouped for their
impact: this was the case, for example, in DC where, probably due to the business and institutional character of the place,
the dryers had a greater impact on the value of the property while self-check-in with lockbox was an indicator of a lower
price, perhaps indicator of less hospitality and lower costs for the host.
Another example is indoor fireplace, a peculiar feature of the accommodations in SF and LA which, although not
considered as a business or premium feature, added uniqueness to the offer with a positive impact of 0.33. Furthermore,
in LA it emerged that amenity smoking allowed reduced the value of the accommodation, demonstrating once again how
focusing on a single narrow slice of the market did not bring added value to the property and resulted in lower prices.
Looking at negative impacting amenities, however, we find primarily “pets living on the property” that despite being a
rare feature, with a percentage ranging from 8.65% in Boston to 17.25% in LA, appears to have a negative impact on the
overall value of the property up to 0.37% in DC. The same goes for the amenity “free parking on premises” which, even
though it is most of the time present in less premium accommodations located far from the city center, was a not-socommon feature with a percentage ranging from 9.69% in NYC to 22.26% in Boston and a negative impact of -0.17.
Concluding, while locks on bedroom doors, most present in private rooms and perceived as a necessity in dangerous
zones, is a common characteristic with a percentage raging from 22.13% in SF to 25.16% in NYC and a negative impact
of -0.26 on the price, translation missing is another popular feature with a percentage ranging from 29.96% in Boston to
40.52% in Chicago and having a negative impact of -0.27 on the value of the property, showing how communication is
fundamental to maximize the potential value of the property.
We proceeded with the analysis of description, a fundamental field used by users to benchmark and understand in few
lines the pros and cons of the accommodation. Our study indicated how different factors of the descriptions has a
different impact on the log price: listings including descriptions of “bedrooms” (+0.32) "views”, “modern”, “open”,
“outdoor” spaces, and proximity to the “heart” of the city or a "village" are, in fact, usually associated with higher prices.

Additionally, we found that descriptions characterized by certain words such as "steps”, "beds”, "entire”, and "re", are
related to higher prices of accommodation.
On the other hand, the presence of certain words such as “shared” (-0.29), “train” (-0.14), or “friendly” (-0.12) are linked
to a more negative impact on the prices. Upon further examination of the cluster “location”, we directed our attention
towards the mode of amenities in each individual neighborhood. Our findings reveal that 78% of the amenities that stood
out were related to "Wireless Internet". Upon delving deeper into the remaining amenities, we discovered a significant
concentration of "Heating" in Central-East America, specifically in cities such as NYC, DC, Chicago, and Boston.
In summary, some unique amenities, while not excessively increasing the price of the accommodation, positively
differentiated it from the others. Furthermore, it was recognized how hosts with greater attention to convenience, security,
and clear communication were able to increase the value of their offer by creating a more desirable and lucrative listing
on Airbnb. Finally, these results suggest that hosts should be aware and careful of their accommodation descriptions,
avoiding emphasizing features that could lower the perceived value of their offer and highlighting those specific amenities
that could lead to higher prices.

The link between the number of listings and the cities’ policies
As it is shown by the graph, there was a boom in the service and demand followed by a rise in the offer between 2011
and 2015 with NYC being the leader of the trend. The trend appeared to be influenced by the policies implemented by the different local governments.
In 2015, in fact, for example, San Francisco implemented new regulations requiring hosts to register
their housing to the city and obtain a permit, followed by Chicago in 2016, and Washington DC in
2018.
Similarly, in 2018, Los Angeles and Boston passed new ordinances forcing hosts to obtain licenses
and requiring them certain safety standards.
Again, NYC has had strict regulations against Airbnb rentals for years, making it illegal for most
hosts to rent out their properties for less than 30 days: these regulations may have had a positive
impact on the trend of listing as their percent change after the first boom dictated by the spreading
of the platform remained relatively stable over the years, with a 7.69% increase in 2015 and a 21.41%
decrease in 2016.
It's important to note that other factors, such as demand from travelers and housing stock
availability, may also have contributed to shifts in Airbnb listings. Additionally, regulations and policies
may change over time, leading to fluctuations in the trend.
A Simpson's paradox
In our analysis we also focused on the relationship between the property type and the room type with
respect to premium houses, houses with a log price higher than the third quantile. The result
resembled the Simpson's paradox. In fact, in all the cities in the most frequent type of property type,
rooms were almost only entire rooms, while private and shared ones disappear completely. When we
focused on this relationship city by city this trend disappeared. Note: doing this operation, we looked
at the third quantile of each city, and thus in each analysis the parameter changed. We are aware of
that, but we still found it relevant.

CITY BY CITY ANALYSIS
General approach
Wanting to group the data according to the geographical position, we realized that the variable
‘neighborhoods’, for reasons related to their size and boundaries, was the best indicator of location.
Once sorted by mean price, the neighborhoods were further analyzed. For each other variable to be investigated, taking into consideration the mean
price, the three most and least expensive neighborhoods were identified and compared based on them: if some particular cost trends, linked to the
examined cofounders, had arisen, the analysis would have proceeded by enlarging the sample of neighborhoods to 10 to verify whether the trends
still occurred. If so, therefore, it could be deduced that these cost differences were attributable to the analyzed variables and their influence on the
price. Below we report the most interesting observations related to the neighborhoods.
Boston
It was evident that for the best 10
and worst 10 neighborhoods, the
mean price for accommodations
with a moderate cancellation
policy was higher than the ones
with other cancellation policy
types. Moreover, for the best 10
neighbourhoods,
accommodations
for
which
instant
bookable
was
not
available had a higher mean price
than the ones that offered it.
Washington DC
Differently from Boston, for the
best 10 neighbourhoods, instantly
bookable accommodations had a
higher mean price than the ones
for which it was not possible.
Furthermore, accommodations of
the same group, where the
cleaning fee was not present, were
characterized by higher average
prices than the ones where it was
present.
New York
In
NYC,
the
number
of
accommodations offered by
verified hosts was higher than
those offered by hosts without
verification (60% vs. 40%).
Additionally, for the top 10
neighborhoods, the price of
both types of accommodations
fluctuated. However, the price of
accommodations of verified
hosts tended to cluster around
the median price for each
neighbourhood more often.

Chicago
Unlike Boston, Chicago’s top 10
neighbourhoods’ mean price for
accommodations was higher for those
characterized by a strict cancellation
policy. In addition, neighbourhoods
with average log price higher than 5
all have an average review score
higher than the ones with a price
lower than 5. Quality pays off! The
higher the number of services offered,
the more the score of the reviews rises
as well as the price of the
accommodations. This last trend also
occurs in Boston and DC.
Los Angeles
For the best 10 neighborhoods
in LA, the mean price for
accommodations with a strict
cancellation policy was higher
than the one of housing
without it.

San Francisco
If we divide the total number of
reviews of each neighborhood for
the number of accommodations of
each neighborhood, we can see
that the higher is the ratio, the
lower the mean price of the
neighborhood is. It could be
hypothesized that the more
reviews an accommodation has,
the more likely there are negative
reviews, thus forcing the host to
lower
the
price
of
the
accommodation.
