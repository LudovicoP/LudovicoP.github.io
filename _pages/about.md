### Featured Projects

- **Bayesian Techniques for Racing Dynamics — Monza 2023 (BSc thesis)** — hierarchical state-space models and Bayesian inference to study tire degradation. [Read more →](/portfolio/portfolio-BayesianRacing/)
- **Credit Scoring (XGBoost & Fairness)** — production-ready XGBoost pipeline with PCA, careful feature engineering and fairness checks (ROC AUC ≈ 0.86). [Read more →](/portfolio/portfolio-CreditScoring/)
- **Airbnb Price Heterogeneity Analysis** — clustering and city-level regressions that identify listing characteristics driving price differences. [Read more →](/portfolio/portfolio-AirBnBAnalysis/)
- **Warning Labels on Super Alcohol — Policy Experiment** — RCT design and econometric analysis of labeling interventions on alcohol consumption and satisfaction. [Read more →](/portfolio/portfolio-AlcoholLabel/)
