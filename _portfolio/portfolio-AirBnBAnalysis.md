excerpt: "Clustering and regression analysis to explain price differences across listings and cities."

This project studies causes of price variation across AirBnB listings in multiple US cities. The analysis identifies five logical clusters of features — placement, host, feedback, location, and services — and examines how those clusters and individual amenities affect listing prices.

Key findings include: entire-home listings command higher prices than private or shared rooms; amenities (TV, A/C, kitchen, pools, doormen) and description keywords (views, modern, outdoor) often explain substantial price differences; and some features have city-specific effects. The work combines descriptive statistics, clustering, and city-by-city regression analyses to reveal heterogeneity in pricing drivers.
