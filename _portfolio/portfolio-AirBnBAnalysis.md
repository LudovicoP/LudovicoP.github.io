Key findings include: entire-home listings command higher prices than private or shared rooms; amenities (TV, A/C, kitchen, pools, doormen) and description keywords (views, modern, outdoor) often explain substantial price differences; and some features have city-specific effects. The work combines descriptive statistics, clustering, and city-by-city regression analyses to reveal heterogeneity in pricing drivers.
