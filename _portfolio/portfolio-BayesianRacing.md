Bachelor thesis applying Bayesian methods (MCMC, HMC) and state-space/spline-based models to racing telemetry (Monza 2023 F1 GP). The work develops hierarchical and Gaussian models, implements inference diagnostics, and interprets latent tire degradation dynamics using probabilistic computation tools.

The thesis contains methodological chapters on priors, likelihoods, model checking, diagnostics, and practical computation techniques, and reports results with extensive model validation.
