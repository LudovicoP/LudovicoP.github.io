title: "Trade Openness and Income Inequality — Paper Discussion"
excerpt: "Empirical replication and extension of trade openness effects on inequality using panel methods."
collection: portfolio

This paper discusses and extends the empirical analysis of the relationship between trade openness and income inequality. The project reviews theoretical foundations (Heckscher–Ohlin, Stolper–Samuelson), constructs five-year averaged panel samples (1970–2014), and implements OLS/FE and 2SLS/IV strategies to address endogeneity.

Results highlight differences across country groups (advanced, EMD, transition economies) and discuss the role of outliers (Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Singapore) and transition countries in driving cross-country correlations.
