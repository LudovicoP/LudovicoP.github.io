Project analyzing the Solow–Swan growth model using country-level panel data. The workflow includes WDI data ingestion, log-transformations, outlier detection (Cook's distance), and regression analyses both with and without influential observations. Results highlight the roles of savings, population growth, and political stability in explaining GDP per capita.
