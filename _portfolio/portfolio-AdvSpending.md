excerpt: "Panel econometric analysis linking advertising intensity to market valuation in healthcare firms."
collection: portfolio

This study investigates determinants of market valuation in the healthcare sector, with a focus on advertising intensity. Using a panel of 1,971 firms (1994–2019; 16,347 observations) the authors estimate fixed- and random-effects models to test whether advertising positively impacts firm market valuation while controlling for R&D, firm size, market growth, and turbulence.

Main takeaway: advertising intensity appears to positively influence market valuation in the healthcare sector, while market growth can have an opposing effect. Robustness checks and interaction terms are used to validate results and derive managerial implications.
