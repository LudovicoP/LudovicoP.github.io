Presentation of a policy experiment that proposes introducing warning labels on high-strength alcohol bottles to increase public awareness and reduce consumption. The project outlines a randomized control trial in supermarkets across Italian cities, describes primary outcomes (alcohol purchases and citizen satisfaction), and specifies models to estimate treatment effects with demographic interactions.

The design includes fidelity-card data and surveys, OLS estimates with interaction terms, and a set of robustness and subgroup analyses to assess heterogeneous treatment effects.
